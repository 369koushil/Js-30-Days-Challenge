# Day 10: Event Handling

## Topics Learned

### Event Handling
- Understanding how to handle events in JavaScript.

### Key Events
- **`keydown`**: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
- **`keyup`**: Triggered when a key is released.

### Event Delegation
- A technique where events are handled on a parent element to manage events for its child elements.
- Improves performance and simplifies event management, especially for dynamic content.

### Form Submission
- **Preventing Default Form Submission**:
  - Using `event.preventDefault()` to stop the form from performing its default action (submitting data and reloading the page).

### Summary
- Event handling involves responding to user interactions and other events.
- `keydown` and `keyup` events are used to detect and respond to keyboard interactions.
- Event delegation simplifies handling events for dynamically added or numerous child elements by attaching a single event listener to a parent.
- Preventing default form submission allows for custom handling of form data without refreshing the page.
